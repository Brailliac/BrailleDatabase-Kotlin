# Adding new codes

I am always looking for people to help add new languages and Braille codes!

Go to https://github.com/Brailliac/BrailleDatabaseKotlin/tree/master/brailledatabase/src/main/java/com/lukeneedham/brailledatabase/Braille/SymbolDatabases and create a new file named: \*SymbolDatabase.java where * is the name, in English, of the new Braille database. You can copy the code from an existing SymbolDatabase file as a template, and tweak it for your new database.

If you need any information, please contact me at brailletutorapp@gmail.com

# Java

There is a also a Java version of this database, which is no longer maintained. It can be found here: https://github.com/Brailliac/BrailleDatabaseJava
